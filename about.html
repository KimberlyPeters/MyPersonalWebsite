		<p><h3>My name is Peters, Mauyon Kimberly, I'm a graduate of the department of Marine Sciences, University of Lagos.
			<br><br>I build luxury aquariums, breed exotic species of fish, maintain and also design aquariums, I also do aquascaping.
			<br><br>I cater for small events and also bake, I love cooking, I love playing with colours and flavours in the kitchen because I feel like that's one of the only place I can be artistic.
			<br><br>I love books, any kind really I also edit books, I like to think of myself as an hopeless romantic. I love LOVE!!!, all types of love; the ability of us being selfless really makes me mushy.
			<br><br>I love music, I listen and sing; the genre of music I listen to is wide: Rap, RnB, Trap, Afro pop and the likes, I particularly love songs with messages to pass I'm really not a fan of "pangolo" music.
			<br><br>I'm a feminist, I know what you're thinking but I'm not one of those twitter raving sisters who don't know what the word means or what they want. I'm a supporter of my sex, I believe in equity not equality because equality isn't always right and while my sex is the superior sex it's absurd that society makes us into the weaker sex and we let them. Gender roles are sometimes condescending, just because I was born with a vagina doesn't mean domestic chores were downloaded in some part of my brain.
			<br><br>I'm a deep person, you might drown in my depths. I'm scared to say the thoughts that run through my mind I might just get locked up. The monsters under my bed are scared of the ones in my head, the battles I've fought and the scars I carry are the a contant reminder of how strong I am. I hate mediocrity and shallow people.
			<br><br>I love to learn, unlearn and relearn and also impact knowledge, learning is so interesting it's probably why I read so much and the ability to teach and improve another person is so fulfilling for me.
			<br><br>I love meeting people I really am a people's person, I find my soulmates in strangest places and connecting with them and hearing their stories is amazing. It's a zing kind of thing. My mother says I'm attracted to societal rejects, LOL, I just find them more interesting than those who kiss society's ass because I don't conform.
			<br><br>Normalcy is an illusion. Stupidity kiiled the cat but curiosity was framed, this i know for sure because I'm curious and still alive.
